Download and Unzip the dataset 
Load the activity and feature info
Loads both the training and test datasets (keeping the columns mean or standard deviation)
Merge All datasets
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file TidyData.txt.
